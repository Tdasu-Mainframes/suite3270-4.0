<a NAME="Name"></a><h2>Name</h2>
mitm - network stream trace facility
<a NAME="Synopsis"></a><h2>Synopsis</h2>
<b>mitm</b> [-p <i>listenport</i>] [-f <i>outfile</i>]
<a NAME="Description"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<b>mitm</b> is a proxy server that traces the data passing through it.
It supports the Sun <i>passthru</i> protocol, where the client writes the
desired host name and port, separated by a space and terminated by a carriage
return and line feed, at the beginning of the session.
<p>
Network data is written in hexadecimal to the specified file.
<p>
The name is derived from its position in the network stream: the man in the
middle.
<a NAME="Options"></a><h2>Options</h2>
<dt><b>-p</b> <i>listenport</i></dt><dd>
Specifies the port to listen on.
The default port is 4200.
<dt><b>-f</b> <i>outfile</i></dt><dd>
Specifies the trace file to create.
The default is
/tmp/mitm.<i>pid</i>.
<a NAME="Example"></a><h2>Example</h2>
The emulator command-line option to route connection through <b>mitm</b>
is:
<p>
<blockquote>-proxy passthru:127.0.0.1:4200</blockquote>
