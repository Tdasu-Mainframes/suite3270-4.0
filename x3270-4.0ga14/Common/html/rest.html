	<h1>x3270 HTTP Scripting Support</h1>
	The x3270 family of emulators support an HTTP server, which implements
	REST APIs to allow the emulator state to be queried and modified by
	scripts. It can also be used interactively from a browser for debug and
	experimentation.
	<h2>Configuration</h2>
	The HTTP server is enabled by the <b>-httpd</b> command-line option
	or the <b>httpd</b> resource. The value is a string that specifies the
	TCP port, and optionally the address to accept connections on. The
	default address is the IPv4 local loopback address, 127.0.0.1. The
	syntax for the option is:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>port</i><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>:</tt><i>port</i><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>*:</tt><i>port</i><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>address</i><tt>:</tt><i>port</i><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[</tt><i>address</i><tt>]:</tt><i>port</i><br>
	<p>
	The address can be a symbolic hostname and the port can be a symbolic
	service name. The address can also be specified as <tt>*</tt>,
	which means to accept connections from any IPv4 address. The syntax
	with the square brackets is intended to use with numeric IPv6
	addresses, to resolve the ambiguity between colons inside the address
	and the colon separating the address from the port.
	<h2>Namespace</h2>
	The namespace looks like this:
	<p>
	<table style="width:100%">
	    <tr>
		<td><b>Object</b></td>
		<td><b>Type</b></td>
		<td><b>Contents</b></td>
	    </tr>

	</table>
	<h2><a id="rest">Common REST Information</a></h2>
	<h3>URL Syntax</h3>
	Each REST object is followed by an arbitrary string parameter. The
	parameter is an x3270 action name, followed by optional parameters.
	For example, the plain text version of the command to execute the
	<b>Enter</b> action is:<br>
	<pre>  /3270/rest/text/Enter%28%29</pre>
	Note that <tt>%28</tt> is the <tt>(</tt> character and
	<tt>%29</tt> is the <tt>)</tt> character, so this request is
	decoded as <tt>Enter()</tt>.
	<p>
	In the REST parameter, special URL characters such as
	<tt>(</tt>, <tt>)</tt>, <tt>?</tt>,
	<tt>&</tt>, <tt>#</tt>, <tt>/</tt>,
	<tt>%</tt> and spaces must be percent-encoded. (A good rule of
	thumb is to percent-encode any character besides upper- and lower-case
	letters and the digits 0-9.)
	<p>
	Character codes above 0xfe need to be percent-encoded in UTF-8. For
	example, the character <tt>&#225;</tt> (U+00E1) would be encoded
	as <tt>%C3%A1</tt>.
	<h3>Responses</h3>
	The response to a REST command depends on the format chosen.
	All responses are encoded in UTF-8.
	<p>
	Failed requests result in bad HTTP status, usually 400 for an invalid
	request and 500 for an internal error. The body of the response, in
	HTML, includes descriptive text for the error.
	<h2>Type-Specific Information</h2>
	<h3><a id="text">Plain Text</a></h3>
	The <tt>/3270/rest/text/</tt> object returns its result as plain
	UTF-8 text, as returned by the x3270 scripting API. For example, the
	following URL:<br>
	<pre>  /3270/rest/text/Query%28CodePage%29</pre>
	might return the following in a text/plain response:
	<pre>  37+</pre>
	followed by CR and LF characters.
	<h3><a id="stext">Plain Text with Status</a></h3>
	The <tt>/3270/rest/stext/</tt> object returns its result as plain
	UTF-8 text, as returned by the x3270 scripting API. In addition, the
	first line of the response is the x3270 scripting status line.
	For example, the following URL:<br>
	<pre>  /3270/rest/stext/Query%28CodePage%29</pre>
	might return the following in a text/plain response:
	<pre>  L U U N N 4 24 80 0 0 0x3800040 -
  37+</pre>
	CR and LF characters terminate each line.
	<h3><a id="html">HTML</a></h3>
	The <tt>/3270/rest/html/</tt> object returns its results in UTF-8
	encoded HTML.
	It is likely more useful for debug and interactive experimentation than
	for scripting.
	<p>
	The title and H1 heading indicate the success of the request.
	<p>
	There are two H2 sections.
	The first is the status line, and the second is the response text.
	The contents of each section is a &lt;PRE&gt; block containing the
	literal text. If the response is empty, the corresponding section has
	the italic string <i>(empty)</i> instead.
	<p>
	At the bottom is a horizontal rule and the x3270 version string.
	<h2>Other Objects</h2>
	<h3><a id="interact">Interactive Form</a></h3>
	The <tt>/3270/interact.html</tt> object is an interactive form. It
	includes a text box for entering actions, a snapshot of the screen
	in with all available text attributes, and the text of the status
	line and response for the most recent command. Entering an empty
	action will refresh the screen display.
	<h3><a id="screen">Screen Snapshot</a></h3>
	The <tt>/3270/screen.html</tt> object is an HTML-formatted snapshot of
	the current screen contents. It uses all available text attributes, and
	is similar to what would be displayed by c3270 or wc3270.
